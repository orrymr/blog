Here's a quick post on matrix multiplication. I'll likely have very little time for more advanced topics in the next month, so here I go with this one.

One of the most crucial changes in my viewpoint came when I learned that matrices, much like functions, _act_ on inputs. Until then, a matrix was just a collection of numbers and matrix multiplication was just a mechanical set of rules used to produce another collection of numbers. I knew that the result of matrix multiplication could be a scalar, a vector or another matrix... but I abandoned any further investigations.

An example Prof. Strang uses in his lectures and book is the _difference matrix_. It looks like this:



 \begin{bmatrix}
  a & b & c \newline
  d & e & f \newline
  g & h & i
 \end{bmatrix}
