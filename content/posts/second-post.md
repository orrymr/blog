Here's a quick blog post on matrix multiplication. I'll likely have very little time for more advanced topics in the next month, so here I go with this one.

One of the most crucial changes in my viewpoint came when I learned that matrices, much like functions, _act_ on inputs. Until then, a matrix was just a collection of numbers and matrix multiplication was something I learned to pass tests and exams. I knew that the result of matrix multiplication could be a scalar, a vector or another matrix... Should I have investigated further? Should I have attempted to understand the inner workings of these machinations when somewhere, out there, was a beer in need of rescue? Well, luckily that beer has been rescued and I'm now fortunate enough to be in a position to unravel said machinations.




` TeX Code `

\begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}


When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
