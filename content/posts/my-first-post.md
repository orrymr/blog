I need a place to document my various ideas as well as the potential products of those ideas. 

I also need a place where I can track my progress; that is, progress on a project I may be working on; or progress on material I'm busy studying. 

I intend to document my pursuits here. I figure, this way, if I commit to something, this way there is some evidence of that commitment... If I see evidence of it I can say: "Oh yeah, at some point I actually intended to complete that!" and it'll be harder for me to back out of that commitment. So really, I'm hoping that this blog helps keep me on track with my goals.
 
Currently, I am busy with [MIT's 18.06 course on linear algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). It's an incredible course presented by [Gilbert Strang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Strang); a man whose passion for mathematics is infectious. As an undergraduate student, I went through the motions of linear algebra mechanically, in order to obtain marks and thus progress to the next year of study. I never really internalized the _concepts_. This is something which hindered me later in my academic career. I'm interested in machine learning and, as with many subjects, linear algebra is a cornerstone. I chose 18.06 because it doesn't spend too much time on proving theorems; rather it aims to convey intuition and understanding by using examples and exposition. Not that proving can't do that, just that it can be difficult to link up those abstract concepts with concrete applications. Maybe I just like Prof Strang's style of teaching. Either way, I've commited to 18.06 and I've gone through about 60% of the material. Right now I'm on the part of the course which deals with Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. For the next while, each post will contain something which I find interesting or particularly illuminating about the section of linear algebra I'm busy learning. It could be an example, or a concept. Either way, it'll come from the section I'm busy with.

My aim is to complete this course by the end of the year. There. I said it. Now there is proof that I've committed.`
