I need a place to document my various ridiculous ideas as well as their resulting artefacts. That there is a resulting artefact assumes that the brain fart of an idea resulted in a spurt of productivity and associated with said artefact.

Further, The People must have a central place to which They can navigate in order to keep updated. This will serve that purpose.

I intend to document my academic pursuits here. I figure, this way, if I commit to learning something, this way there is some evidence of that commitment... and the resulting _shame_ in the abandonment of that pursuit. Currently, I am busy with MIT's 18.06 course on linear algebra.
