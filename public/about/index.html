Orry, if you&rsquo;re reading this at some point in the future (your present), know that current (past) you wants you to flesh out this section more thoroughly. Explain to The People that you wish this blog to be about tech, music and any other fanciful thing that keeps your attention for long enough to blog about it. The People must know that you are an elitist metalhead who probably thinks that their collective taste in music is rubbish. The People must know that occasionally you write dystopic short fiction (although it&rsquo;s not always dystopic, short or fictional). Let them know that you enjoy playing guitar, writing music and posting covers of songs on YouTube. Explain to them that this blog is an eclectic collection of brain farts. Also, I hope that future (present) you has found your other shoe. This is getting ridiculous and my left foot is cold.</p>
